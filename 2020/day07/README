Visopsys (VISual OPerating SYStem) 
------------------------------------------


Visopsys[1] is an alternative operating system for PC-compatible computers,
written “from scratch”, and developed primarily by a single hobbyist programmer
since 1997.

The recent release adds support for various networking components, including a
telnet implementation. First, run ifconfig to enable the network. If you are
interested in connecting to something via telnet, you might try

They goal of Visopsys is to be small, fast, and capable of handling various partition
tables and types.
