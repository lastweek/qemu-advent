GW-BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language and it came with
MS-DOS. It was open-sourced on May 21st 2020 under the MIT License. Although it
was only released by Microsoft for reference and study, others have
collaborated to get the code to assemble and run again.

This disk image boots into GW-BASIC. The original GW-BASIC user manual can be
found online with a list of available statements. The most essential are:
 * PRINT "HELLO WORLD" - display text
 * 10 ...
   GOTO 10 - loop
 * SYSTEM - exit to DOS

The famous BASIC game DONKEY.BAS is included as a demo that you can run by
entering F3 DONKEY.BAS" <Enter> F2. This file comes from the MS-DOS 1.25 open
source release:

The GW-BASIC.EXE binary is from
https://github.com/tkchia/GW-BASIC/releases/tag/20201025. It runs on a FreeDOS
1.2 disk image with GPL sources included inside the disk image. This image was
