QEMU Advent Calendar 2018:

F-Bird
------

This is a great little game by Ã“scar Toledo G., which fits into a 512-bytes
boot sector! Press a key to start the game. Gravity makes you to fall, press
any key to fly.

Please have a look at the readme.txt or https://github.com/nanochess/fbird
for some more information.
